A total of 106 primary liver tumors were studied by RT-PCR (26 fibrolamellar carcinomas, 25 conventional hepatocellular carcinomas, 25 cholangiocarcinomas, 25 hepatic adenomas, and 5 hepatoblastomas). FISH was tested in 19 fibrolamellar carcinomas and in 6 scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas. Evidence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion was found in all fibrolamellar cases but not in other tumor types for both methods indicating that detection of DNAJB1-PRKACA is a very sensitive and specific finding in support of the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma.	25698061	Graham et al., 2015, Mod.

EGFR	1956	T790M	Lung Cancer	1324	AEE788,Gefitinib	,	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates WT EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	5
